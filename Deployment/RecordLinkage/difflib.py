# Loop through each record in the first dataset

    # Loop through each record in the second dataset
    for record2 in data2:
        # Use difflib to compare the records
        seq = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, record1, record2)
        # If the match ratio is greater than a threshold, consider them a match

# Print the matches
print(matches)
This code uses the difflib module to compare the records from the two datasets and determine if they are likely to be the same record. The threshold for the match ratio is set to 0.8, but you can adjust this value to suit your needs.

Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and there are many other ways to approach the problem of identity resolution. You may need to use additional techniques, such as deduplication or probabilistic matching, depending on the specifics of your data and the desired accuracy of your results.
